This is a talk about Go's `testing/quick` package. It was delivered:

* At GoSF, on June 23, 2014. This version is under quick-gosf.slide.
* At GoAKL, on August 20, 2014. This version is under quick-goakl.slide.

There are some minor tweaks to the GoAKL version, but both are largely the same.

The slides are best viewed with the present tool. Install it like this:

        go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present

This presentation uses a slightly modified style, so to view it run
(from the repository directory):

        present -base=.
