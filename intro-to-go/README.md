This is an introduction to the Go programming language. The talk was fairly interactive and the slides probably aren't a great learning resources, but here they are. Most learners would be better served by the [Go Tour](https://tour.golang.org/).

The slides are best viewed with the present tool. Install it like this:

This talk was originally delivered internally at Vend in two parts on separate days: February 20 and 27, 2017
