This is a repository of slides from talks I've given. Each directory has
a separate README describing the talk and when and where it was delivered.

In chronological order by when the talk was first delivered:

* testing-quick - A talk about Go's `testing/quick` package
* ssa - A talk about the static single assignment representation in the Go 1.7 compiler
* interfaces - A talk about Go interface internals
* intro-to-go - An introduction to the Go programming language
